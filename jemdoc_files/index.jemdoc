Welcome to my personal website! I recently received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from [https://stanford.edu Stanford University], primarily focusing on semiconductor modeling and
optimization. I was advised by Prof. [https://profiles.stanford.edu/srabanti-chowdhury Srabanti Chowdhury] and worked closely with Prof. [https://stanford.edu/~boyd/ Stephen Boyd]. Before
Stanford, I graduated from [https://gatech.edu Georgia Tech] with a B.S. and M.S. in Electrical Engineering. My current interests include semiconductor modeling, machine learning, optimization, and electronic design.
